#   -------------------- OPERATORS -------------------------

# 1) Arithmetic operator.
# 2) Assignment operator.
# 3) relation and comparision opeartor.
# 4) logical and bitwise operator
# 5) Membership operator.
# 6). Identity operator.

# 1) Arithmetic operator :-
                           ● a) Addition.
                           ● b) substraction
                           ● c) Multiplication
                           ● d) Division
                           ● e) modulus(%)
                           ● f) floor division
                           ● g) Exponential

# a) Addition :-
a = 10
b = 20
c = a + b
# print(c)

# b) substraction :-
a = 10
b = 20
c = a - b
#print(c)

# c) Multiplication :-
a = 10
b = 20
c = a * b
# print(c)

# d) Division :-
a = 10
b = 20
c = a / b
#print(c)

# e) modulus (%):- 
a = 17
b = 3
c = a % b
#print(c)

# f) floor division (//):- It gives divide first value.
a = 15
b = 2
c = a // b
#print(c)

# # g) Exponential (**):-
a = 2
b = 3
c = a ** b
#print(c)

# # 2) Assignment operator (=) :-
a = 12
#print(a)

a +=  7 # increment
#print(a)                                                                                                                             

# 3) relation and comparision opeartor :-
#       >           !=
#       <           ==
#       >=
#       <=


a = 10
b = 20
c = a < b
#print(c)

d = a != b
#print(d)

# 4) logical and bitwise operator :-
#       and         ^
#       or
#       &
#       | - (pipe)

#add = True + True
#or = True + False = True

a = True
b = False
c = a ^ b
#print(c)

a = 5
b = 4
c = a | b
#print(c)        # output :- 4

#1 2 4 6 8 12 16 32 64 128 


# 5) Membership operator (in , not in):- To chcek data is exist or not
ls = ["Rahul" , "Ram" , "Rupesh" , "Aman"]
ls1 = "Ram"
c = ls1 in ls
d = ls1 not in ls
#print(c)
#print(d)

# 6) Identity operator (is , is not):- Identify the data if they are same then they used single memory.

a = 2
b = 2
c = a is b
q = a is not b
#print(c)
#print(q)
